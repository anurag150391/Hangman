# Hangman
This repository houses a Python-based Hangman game, created during my second week at a data science bootcamp. Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.

# Overview
Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a simple Python-based Hangman game developed during my second week at a data science bootcamp. Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.

In this project, I aimed to practice my Python programming skills by creating a basic version of the Hangman game. You can play this game interactively in a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.

# Features
- Interactive Hangman gameplay.
- Randomly selected words from a predefined word list.
- Visual representation of the Hangman as the game progresses.
- User-friendly prompts and feedback.

# Getting Started
To play the Hangman game or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/anurag150391/Hangman.git
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Hangman.ipynb) in Google Colab or your preferred Python environment.

3. Run the notebook cells to play the game or review the code.

# How to Play
1. Run the game code cell in the notebook.
2. You will be prompted to guess letters one at a time.
3. Continue guessing letters until you either:
  - Successfully guess the word.
  - Run out of attempts, resulting in a loss.
# Customization
Feel free to customize the game by making changes to the code. Some ideas for customization include:

- Adding more words to the word list.
- Modifying the number of allowed incorrect guesses.
- Enhancing the user interface.
